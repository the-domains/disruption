description: "In what could be regarded as alarming news not only to the sports channel but also its rivals, research from BTIG has concluded that ESPN could face a subscriber exodus in 2016. In a report written by respected analyst Richard Greenfield, BTIG believes that ESPN is in serious trouble, having been 'vastly' over-earning and that it is now incapable of fulfilling its plan of going direct-to-consumer (DTC)."
